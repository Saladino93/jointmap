# Joint MAP reconstruction

This code allows to run Maximum A Posteriori reconstruction following algorithms of CMB lensing reconstruction presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08230 .Please, refer to arXiv: for details.

To run your reconstructions, go in the `scripts` directory and follow the `README` file there.

To use the code, you need:
